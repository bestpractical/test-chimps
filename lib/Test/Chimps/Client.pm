=head1 NAME

Test::Chimps::Client - Send smoke test results to a server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module simplifies the process of sending smoke test results
(in the form of C<Test::TAP::Model>s) to a smoke server.

    use Test::Chimps::Client;
    use Test::TAP::Model::Visual;

    chdir "some/module/directory";

    my $model = Test::TAP::Model::Visual->new_with_tests(glob("t/*.t"));

    my $client = Test::Chimps::Client->new(
      server => 'http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/smoke-server.pl',
      model  => $model
    );
    
    my ($status, $msg) = $client->send;
    
    if (! $status) {
      print "Error: $msg\n";
      exit(1);
    }
