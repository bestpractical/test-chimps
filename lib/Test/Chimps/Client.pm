=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module simplifies the process of sending C<Test::Chimps::Report>s to a
smoke server.

    use Test::Chimps::Report;
    use Test::Chimps::Client;
    use Test::TAP::Model::Visual;

    chdir "some/module/directory";

    my $model = Test::TAP::Model::Visual->new_with_tests(glob("t/*.t"));

    my $report = Test::Chimps::Report->new(model => $model);

    my $client = Test::Chimps::Client->new(reports => [$report],
                                           server => 'http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/smoke-server.pl');
    
    my ($status, $msg) = $client->send;
    
    if (! $status) {
      print "Error: $msg\n";
      exit(1);
    }
