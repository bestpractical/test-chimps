Test-Chimps

This module modularizes the pugs smoke server/client
(smokeserv-client.pl and smokeserv-server.pl).  It also makes the
code more generic so that other groups can take advantage of the
simple but powerful smoke server. It will provide scripts to
replicate pugs' scripts behavior in a more generic fashion.
